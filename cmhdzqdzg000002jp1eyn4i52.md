## **Done = Certified, Secure, Fast** *(Acceptance Criteria)*

| **I Deliver** | **Proof in Action** |

| **Security Hardened** | **OWASP, SAST/DAST, Burp Suite, Keycloak, FIPS 140** |
| **Compliance Locked** | **ISO 26262, DO-178C, MISRA, IEC 61508, WCAG 2.2** |
| **Performance Proven** | **JMeter + 10K users, &lt;2s latency, SLA dashboards** |
| **CI/CD Gatekeeper** | **Jenkins + GitLab + Docker/K8s → 95% auto-pass or block** |
