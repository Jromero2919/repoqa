## 🎯 GOAL: Be job-ready (QA / Cloud / DevSecOps roles)

**Focus areas:**

1. **AWS Cloud Foundations** – federal cloud migrations.
    
2. **Terraform / Infrastructure as Code** – to automate test environments.
    
3. **DevSecOps & Secure Testing** – to show you understand compliance and RMF basics.
    
4. **Security Awareness (NIST / RMF)** – needed for government projects.

## 🗓️ **3-Month Free Learning Plan**

### 🔹 Month 1: AWS + Cloud Fundamentals

> *Goal: Understand how cloud environments are built and tested.*

**Free resources:**

* 🎓 [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws/) → *“AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials”* (free course)
    
* 🧠 AWS Educate → Create a free account; use their sandbox environment to practice creating EC2, S3, and IAM users.
    
* 🧩 Project:
    
    * Spin up a **free EC2 instance**,
        
    * Connect via SSH,
        
    * Deploy a simple “Hello World” Python app,
        
    * Terminate it safely (to avoid billing).
        

🧾 **Result:** You’ll understand cloud deployment, IAM, and networking — terms uses in every cloud job.

### 🔹 Month 2: Terraform + Automation

> *Goal: Learn to automate environment creation — a huge skill.*

**Free resources:**

* 🧰 [HashiCorp Learn: Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials) (official, free)  
    Start with:
    
    * *Get Started – AWS Provider*
        
    * *Provision EC2 instance*
        
* 💡 Practice: Write Terraform scripts to create and destroy an EC2 instance (using your AWS free-tier account).
    
* 🐚 Use **Cloud Shell** or **GitHub Codespaces** (both free) — no local installs needed.
    

🧾 **Result:** You can create repeatable cloud environments — uses Terraform for automation in DevSecOps teams.

### 🔹 Month 3: DevSecOps + NIST Security Basics

> *Goal: Understand secure QA, risk management, and compliance testing.*

**Free resources:**

* 🔒 **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** – free PDF: [NIST.gov/CSF](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)  
    → Read the “Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover” sections.
    
* 🧰 **NIST RMF Overview** (Risk Management Framework):  
    Watch free YouTube videos: *“NIST RMF in 10 Minutes”* or *“RMF for DoD Projects”*.
    
* 🧩 **DevSecOps Basics:**
    
    * YouTube: *“DevSecOps Explained – IBM Tech”*
        
    * *“Intro to Jenkins”* and *“CI/CD Pipeline with Security Scans”* (TechWorld with Nana).
        
* 🔍 **Practical Project:**
    
    * Create a simple *QA pipeline* using GitHub Actions (free)
        
    * Add a basic security scan (like `bandit` for Python)
        
    * Document it as “My Secure CI/CD Sandbox.”
        

🧾 **Result:** You’ll understand how QA fits into secure CI/CD pipelines — exactly what expects for cloud and security engineers.
